# THE-PERFECT-GUESS
This project generates a random number and asks the user to guess it.

•	If the player's guess is higher than the actual number, it displays "Lower Number Please".

•	Similarly if the user's guess is too low, it displays "Higher Number Please"

•	When the user guesses the correct number , it displays the number of guesses the player used to arrive at the number.
